# BYUI-W02
Card game. The python file will choose two random card values and it will only tell you the first one. You guess whether the second card is higher or lower then the first value.
From there you'll get 100 points if you're right and -75 points if you get it wrong.
The game will end when you have less than 0 points, or when you say you don't want to play again.
